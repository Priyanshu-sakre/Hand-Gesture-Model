# Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN
This project is a hand gesture recognition system capable of accurately identifying over 30 distinct hand signs. The model is built on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and features comprehensive data preprocessing for optimal performance.

## Key Features
Accurate Recognition: Successfully recognizes 30+ different hand gestures.
Data Preprocessing: 20,000 grayscale images were preprocessed by resizing to 50x50 pixels, normalizing pixel values, and one-hot encoding gesture labels using Pandas.
CNN Architecture: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for feature extraction and classification of hand gestures.
## Libraries Used
Pandas: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
TensorFlow/Keras (or specify your CNN framework): For building and training the CNN model.
